# WebP to MP4 Conversion Script

This script converts animated WebP files into MP4 video files. It extracts individual frames from the WebP file, saves them as PNG images, and assembles them into an MP4 video using the MoviePy library.

How to Use
    Place the WebP files you want to convert into a folder.
    Edit the script to point to the folder containing WebP files by modifying the webp_folder variable:
